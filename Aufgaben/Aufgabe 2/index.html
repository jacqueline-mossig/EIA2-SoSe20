                It’s nearly like a normal memory…</br>
                You have to memorize all the cards with the respective letters of a specific word. After a limited time the cards get covored, so be quick to memorize them all. To bring them in the right order, you have to click on the cards. But be careful: You only have limited time for that. So hurry up!
                Hint: You have one joker per game, who shows all cards again, for as long as you hold ‘Spacebar‘.
